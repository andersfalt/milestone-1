## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    -   #### First Time Visitor Goals

        1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the product.
        2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.
        3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to contact the company should I have further questions about the product.

    -   #### Returning Visitor Goals

        1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find information on if the backpacks have been released yet.
        2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the company with any questions I may have.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The two main colours used are gray and aqua.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Titillium Web font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Titillium Web is a clean and some what futuristic font that suits the project.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. The large, background hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It also has a modern, and futuristic feel.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the product.

        1. Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the section of their choice.
        Underneath there is a Hero Image with Text and a "Pre Order" Call to action button (See image below). Which opens a modal overlay order form.
        2. The main points are made immediately with the hero image
        3. The user has two options, click the call to action button or scroll down. By scrolling down or clicking the navigation the user will learn more about the product.


    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find content.

        1. The site has been designed to be fluid. At the top of the page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what section they will end up at.
        2. The user can also scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate social media links in the footer.
        3. At the bottom of the site there is a very easy to understand Contact Us form. Under the contact form are icon links to the company social media platforms.

### Testing

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone Xs Max.
-   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that the site works on all devices and that all the links work.

### Known Bugs

-   When pressing the pre order button and the modal window opens the hero image shifts a bit to the right on all browsers.

### Deployment

The current deployment of this project was done using gitpod.

I used the gitpod interface to write the code and as it is linked with github as it was easy to use the terminal to commit my files and push to my repository.

The deployed website is hosted on github pages for easy viewing without having to clone or fork the repository to view the running website.
Deployment was done by clicking on the settings tab on my repository then navigating to "Github pages"
Changing the source from none to master, this then deployed a link that can be found here : https://github.com/andersfalt/milestone-1

If you wish to run this project locally.

1. Click clone / download
2. Choose your preffered method (Zip or github desktop)
3. Open in your preffered IDE
4. Run on local server


## Planned features to be implemented

- Add the ability to place an order on the site
- Customer login section to track orders
- Add more products to give returning visitors a better selection
